[**无之设计**](https://mooool.com/designer/wuzhi-design)：尝试在多元现代的快节奏城市中，营造简单自然温暖的元古风

元古雲境深圳万象天地店位于深圳南山区万象天地里巷最把头的位置，其优越的地理位置让路过这里的客人不由自主地观望到这个说不上来是什么空间的入口，也许是好奇心，也许是不太常见的材料，这一股元古风从北京，上海，成都，一路南下，吹到深圳，停住了脚步。

[**WUZHI Design**](https://mooool.com/designer/wuzhi-design): Attempt to create a simple, natural and warm Yuangu Style in a diverse and modern fast-paced city.

Yuangu Yunjing Restaurant is located at the entrance of alley in Shenzhen MixC. Its superior geographical location allows passersby to observe this inexplicable entrance, perhaps due to curiosity or uncommon materials. The wave of Yuangu culture has traveled southward from Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, to Shenzhen.

里巷汇集了全球各地的风味，而元古坐落在二层最西侧，入口设置在一层，主要的营业空间位于二层。由于连接一二层空间的楼梯是新建的，六米多的层高给这个项目增加了不小的施工难度，一层与门头施工，楼梯结构施工，还有二层的施工基本被割裂成了三部分，各部门工种的协调与配合以及疫情政策下的临时变动，对整个项目的完成质量和完成度都是非常大的挑战。

The alleys gather flavors from all over the world, while Yuanguyunjing is located on the western side of the first floor, with the entrance set on the ground floor and the main dining space located on the first floor. Due to the newly constructed staircase connecting the ground and first floor, a height of over six meters has increased the construction difficulty of this project. The construction of entrance facade, the structure of the staircase, and the construction of the first floor have been divided into three parts. The coordination and cooperation of various departments’ work types, as well as temporary changes under the epidemic policy, pose a great challenge to the completion quality of the entire project.

一层入口位于市政道路的上坡处，首先映入眼帘的是一个巨大的窗口，仔细看那棵海岛春花探出头来，好似在迎接每一位进入元古雲境的客人，而她的右手边便是大门。踏入元古的第一节台阶，你便开始了对元古的探索，漫长的台阶踏步怕是会让客人感到烦闷。而我们将其分成四跑楼梯，第一跑结束后是元古商店，这里展示了很多好玩儿的老物件，精致小巧，不经意间可以望到角落里用植物染料做成的装饰画；接着第二跑楼梯的尽头，洞穴里面静置了一个破碎的坛子，蜡烛散发着微弱的光源；就在楼梯的第三跑转角处，客人的视线总会透过木棍屏风的遮挡，若隐若现看到二层的用餐空间；如果站在二层仔细观擦，便会发现一层的茶室天花和二层空间是连通的，巨大的结构梁虽不能上人，但散落在结构上的碎片都在诉说元古的故事，如果说楼梯是连接世外桃源的桥梁，而使用空间构成的手法去创作这个桥梁才是设计过程中最有趣的部分。

The entrance of the ground floor is located on the uphill of the municipal road. The first thing that catches your eyes is a huge window. The island spring flower protrudes its head, as if welcoming every guest entering Yuangu, and to her right is the main gate. Stepping into the first step of Yuangu, you start to explore her, and the long steps may make guests feel bored. We divided it into four running stairs, and after the first run, there is the yuangu store, which shows many interesting old objects, exquisite and small, and inadvertently could see decorative paintings made of plant dyes in the corner; At the end of the second running stairs, a shattered jar is standing in the cave, and the candle is emitting a faint light source; At the third corner of the staircase, the guest’s sight is always obscured by a wooden stick screen, and they can vaguely see the dining space on the first floor; If you stand on the first floor and carefully observe, you will find that the tea room ceiling on the ground floor is connected to the space on the first floor. Although the huge structural beams cannot be accessed, the scattered fragments on the structure tell the story of the Yuangu. If the stairs are a bridge connecting the paradise, it is the most interesting part of the design process by using spatial composition and creating more attractive space.

二层空间是常见的框架结构，大面的落地玻璃窗给客人们提供了很好的景观位，在过往的元古雲境案例中中规中矩的平面实在常见，打破规整的平面是我们这次设计最重要的尝试，我们将整个平面的玻璃肋进行了 45 度角斜向交叉划分，打破矩形平面随之而来的是四周破碎的三角形空间，但这恰恰满足了元古一座一景的需求，用老石头和植物在这些空间造景，将劣势转化为优势；45 度的斜向交叉并不影响用餐区的使用，将视角最封闭的三角空间留给厨房使用，近 100 多平米的厨房可以在用餐高峰期满足负荷，中间的水吧台可以供应茶饮及酒品，再与水系相结合，即使在远离景观位的用餐区也可以享受到水流与雾气带来的凉意。仰望天空，客人可以感受被包裹的小空间，这更像是一个小细胞或者小胶囊，源于中国古建筑的装饰性木结构顶棚——藻井。为了减少客人用餐时的相互打扰，采用了屏风隔断设计，在玻璃上粘贴来自西双版纳的手工纸浆，营造更加拙美自然的效果。

The plan of first floor is a common framework structure, and the large ceiling glass windows provide guests with a good view. In past cases of Yuanguyunjing, the plans are very common. In order to break this regular logic, we tried to divide the glass ribs at a 45 degree diagonal intersection, and breaking the rectangular plan brings about the broken triangular space around, But this precisely meets the needs of the Yuangu, where old stones and plants were used to create landscapes in these spaces, transforming disadvantages into advantages; The 45 degree diagonal intersection does not affect the use of the dining area, leaving the most enclosed triangular space for the kitchen to use. The nearly 100 square meter kitchen can meet the load during peak dining hours, and the bar in the middle can provide tea and wine. Combined with the water system, even in the dining area far away from the landscape, you can enjoy the coolness brought by water flow and mist. Looking up at the sky, guests can feel the enclosed small space, which is more like a small cell or capsule, originating from the decorative wooden structure ceiling of ancient Chinese architecture – the caisson. In order to reduce mutual disturbance among guests during meals, a screen partition design is adopted, and handmade pulp from Xishuangbanna is pasted on the glass to create a more clumsy and natural effect.

无之设计意在通过建筑空间和产品设计来探索属于国人的生活方式，我们尊重自然，走进自然，热爱生活。尽管第一次将元古带入如此快节奏的都市当中，简单，自然，温暖依旧是我们的态度。传播中国文化是我们的使命。愿每一个来元古雲境做客的朋友，可以用心感受，也许猛然间的一个抬头一个回眸，设计师的小心思就被悄无声息地揭开。

Wuzhi Design aims to explore the lifestyle of Chinese people through architectural space and product design. We respect nature, enter nature, and love life. Despite bringing the Yuanguyunjing into such a fast-paced city for the first time, simplicity, nature, and warmth are still our attitudes. Spreading Chinese culture is our mission. May every friend who comes to Yuanguyunjing as a guest feel it with their heart. Perhaps with a sudden look up and a glance back, the designer’s careful thinking will be quietly revealed.

项目的施工周期历时三个月整，从 2022 年 10 月进场到 2022 年 12 月底完工，几经周折，从现场放线，样品材料确认，设计调整修改等等，几方团队的高度配合才有了现在的华南首店，再次感谢每一位为元古雲境华南首店付出的伙伴们，每一个渺小的举动都让她变的如此伟大。

The construction period of this project lasted for three months, from October 2022 to the end of December 2022. After several twists and turns, from on-site dimension, confirmation of sample materials, design adjustments and modifications, etc., the high cooperation of several teams led to the current First Store in South China. Once again, I would like to express my gratitude to every partner who has contributed to this store in Shenzhen. Every small move has made her so great.
